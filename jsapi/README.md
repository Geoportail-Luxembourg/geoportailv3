# JS API

This directory contains utility scripts and source files for building and using
the JS API.

## Build JS API

```sh
make -f configfile.mk build-js-api
```

## Development

The JS API comes with examples along with a handy server to make it easier for
the JS API developpers.

Launch the following command:

```
make -f configfile.mk serve-js-api
```

The JS API source code should follow the OL3 development guidelines.
